# ANALYSIS OF LONG TERM  IMD DATASET 
## **DATA SET 1** :

### IMD New High Spatial Resolution (0.25X0.25 degree) Long Period (1901-2021) Daily Gridded Rainfall Data Set Over India.
You can get more info about the dataset and the source here : 
> #### https://www.imdpune.gov.in/Clim_Pred_LRF_New/Grided_Data_Download.html 

The dataset has been used to establish the trend in rainfall (in mm ) over the region of Mumbai **(lat : 18.75,19.25 ; lon :72.50, 73.00  )** with the help of timeseries which is plotted decade wise. The dataset covers the entire region of India. The unit of rainfall is milimetres.

## **DATA SET 2** :

### IMD High resolution 1 By 1 degree gridded daily temperature data (1951-2020) [ Max Temperature ]

You can get more info about the dataset and the source here : 
> #### https://www.imdpune.gov.in/Clim_Pred_LRF_New/Grided_Data_Download.html 

This data is arranged in (31x31) grid points. **(Lat 7.5N, 8.5N ... 36.5, 37.5)** ,  **(Long 67.5E, 68.5E ... 96.5, 97.5)**.  For leap years, data for 366 days are included. The unit of tempereture is in Celcius. The dataset represents the highest temperature recorded in a day.

Gridded data for the year 2008 and onwards are based on relatively less number of stations (around 180) for which data were received operationaly on real time basis.

The analysis has been done over the region of Mumbai **(lat : 18.75,19.25 ; lon :72.50, 73.00  )**. The trend has been plotted decadewise. A clearer trend is obserrved upon plotting the entire data in one plot.

## **DATA SET 3** :

### IMD High resolution 1By1 degree gridded daily temperature data (1951-2020) [ Min Temperature ]

You can get more info about the dataset and the source here : 
> #### https://www.imdpune.gov.in/Clim_Pred_LRF_New/Grided_Data_Download.html 

This data is arranged in (31x31) grid points. **(Lat 7.5N, 8.5N ... 36.5, 37.5)** ,  **(Long 67.5E, 68.5E ... 96.5, 97.5)**.  For leap years, data for 366 days are included. The unit of tempereture is in Celcius. The dataset represents the lowest temperature recorded in a day.

Gridded data for the year 2008 and onwards are based on relatively less number of stations (around 180) for which data were received operationaly on real time basis.

The trend has been plotted decadewise. A clearer trend is obserrved upon plotting the entire data in one plot.
