# Surface Albedo Effect
Albedo refers to the capability of a surface to reflect the light / heat of Sun falling on it.
### High Albedo Surfaces
These surface are mostly light colored. They reflect major portion of light/heat waves falling on them.
### Low Albedo Surfaces
These surfaces are generally dark colored. They absorb major portion of light/heat waves fallinh on themselves.

## Which is better for our climate : 'Lower Albedo' or a 'Higher Albedo'?
The **lower the albedo**, the more radiation from the Sun that gets absorbed by the planet, and **temperatures will rise**.
<br>
If the **albedo is higher**, and the Earth is more reflective, more of the radiation is returned to space, and the **planet cools**.
